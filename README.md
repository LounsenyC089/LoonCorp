# LoonCorp

This repository contains the beginnings of a simple website for a fictional
company called **LoonCorp**. The project structure includes
placeholder pages and directories where future assets will live.

## Structure

- `pages/` - HTML pages for the site
  - `home.html`
  - `about.html`
  - `services.html`
  - `projects.html`
  - `contact.html`
- `assets/images/` - images and media
- `assets/css/` - stylesheets

At the moment the HTML files only include minimal placeholder content.
Future updates will add styling and real copy.
